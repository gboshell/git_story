    Yes, typing. Don’t think about holidays, weekend trips, weekends off or even nights off. If it wasn’t<br>
    typing it was something else, something that required immediate attention. Deadlines rose and feel,<br>

    constant wave that brought a new one, or two.

    break, take a break and come back to it. It was not going to go away.
