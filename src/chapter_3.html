<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>
    It had been a long weekend, a bank holiday, but he had to work. He took two of the days off, he <br>
    deserved it, midterm was a long way off and he didn’t want to get burnt out. The last day he worked.<br>
    He worked from early the morning to late at night. He only took brakes t rest his eyes and eat his <br>
    dinner. He showered, he promised himself that he would try to stay clean, he had to re-join the<br>
    normal world eventually. He hoped it would be soon.

    His PC died today. He tried to save it, but it was gone. Luckily, he had backed up his college work and<br>
    photos. Lost were some three hundred movies and some thirteen thousand songs, collected over<br>
    the years, but nothing that couldn’t be replaced. So now he just had to move some stuff around, his<br>
    laptop was brand new and would serve until he could get a replacement, He was surprisingly upbeat <br>
    about the whole thing.

   He hated typing now, he wanted to stop. He picked up his keyboard and threw it through the open window<br>
    He ran down the stair and out the door. He ran to teh end of the road. He thought about stopping but <br>
    he couldn't, he would never go back to that keyboard or type again.
