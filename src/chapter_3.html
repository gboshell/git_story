<p>
    It had been a long weekend, a bank holiday, but he had to work. He took two of the days off, he <br>
    deserved it, midterm was a long way off and he didnâ€™t want to get burnt out. The last day he worked.<br>
    He worked from early the morning to late at night. He only took brakes t rest his eyes and eat his <br>
    dinner. He showered, he promised himself that he would try to stay clean, he had to re-join the<br>
    normal world eventually. He hoped it would be soon.
