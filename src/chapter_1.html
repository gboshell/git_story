    He started to type. It was not even nine yet but it felt much later. Assignments were piling up like so much trash and he<br> hadn’t had a day off since the beginning of the semester. He stopped, he had been sweating, he guessed<br> that he smelled terrible and decided to check, yes, it was bad. He wanted to take a shower but couldn’t find a<br> time slot to allot to a task that would take fifteen minutes, that would distract him from his endless typing.

    He typed. Some of it he understood, some he didn’t, some things worked for him, some not.<br> He promised himself that he would catch up later and make sure he understood it all, but in the back of<br> his mind he knew he wouldn’t. Who had the time for that, all he had time for was typing these days,<br> the learning he could do later.

    Whatever he was doing it was clearly not working, he screamed at the screen and forced himself not<br> to punch it. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths. Maybe it was time for that shower. He<br> got up, slightly dazed, so this was what it was like to not sit at a screen and type. The shower helped,<br> while he was drying himself off, he suddenly felt great, maybe I will go outside one day, outside that<br> didn’t involve going to college or gong to buy food.
